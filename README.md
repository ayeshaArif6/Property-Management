# PropertyManagement


## Project Overview
PropertyManagement is primarily a VBA project that extracts property information from an excel sheet and stores relevent data in an Access database. This data comprises of property adresses, tenant data, rent, lease, balance and overdue payments. There is an Admin named 'Sparky' that has full access to each of the properties and is able to view their information and make necassary changes. There is also a support staff role that doesnt have as much control as the Admin, but can view notifications regarding the properties that are under them. Lastly, there is an Analyst, that tis able to view quartly and annual reports regarding each property. 

Users are not able to access, view, or edit the excel spreadsheet in any way. The Admin is the only user that has this access. Each user role can only interact with the system in the form of a user interface, constructed entirely using Visual Basic for Applications(VBA). Changes made to the interface are reflected directly in the spreedsheet and in the database as well.
